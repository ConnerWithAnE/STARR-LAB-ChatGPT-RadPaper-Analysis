spacecraft that were designed to withstand space radiation
effects.

Abstract—This paper documents radiation effects observed in
selected spacecraft at the system and subsystem levels, and where
possible, relates them to predicted radiation effects in parts.
Comparisons are also made as functions of design paradigm,

II. PREFACE
Before beginning discussions of anomalies, it is important
to stress a few points. The most important point to remember
is that, in many cases, observed anomalies or component failures have occurred long after the intended or expected design
life. Such systems have met every criterion for success, and
such a system can scarcely be criticized for experiencing
“failures” after all requirements have been met. Indeed, most
of the spacecraft mentioned herein have been very successful
in completing their mission goals. The point is simply to note
what component or systems failures are observed, even if they
are beyond their design life, and determine if this information
can be of use in future designs, some of which may have even
longer life or higher radiation requirements.

INTRODUCTION
Most available technical information on radiation effects is
for component or subsystem tests, and such tests are almost
always limited to terrestrial radiation simulators (e.g., ion
beam accelerators, Cobalt-60 cells, etc.). Very few studies
have addressed radiation effects observed in space at the system level, although some spacecraft have carried component
test boards for the express purpose of testing significant numbers of parts in space expected to be susceptible to radiation
effects. This paper concentrates on system-level responses
observed and/or predicted to occur in spacecraft electronic and
optoelectronic parts due to radiation exposure, and where possible, correlation between the two. Missions considered in this
paper were selected on the basis of experiencing “interesting”
or otherwise significant anomalies providing information on
various radiation effects in systems. Typical single-event upsets (SEUs) are not noted herein, as they are expected and
almost always mitigated. Table 1 lists the missions considered
in this paper.

Various radiation effects have been predicted to occur in
spacecraft electronic parts due to the different types of radiation in space. A number of flight anomalies have been observed in spacecraft. This paper gathers analytical predictions,
assembles available observational data from the spacecraft,
and where possible, compares data with predictions. The
goals are not only to correlate observations with predictions,
thereby improving our knowledge of space radiation effects,
but also to provide guidance in designs of future spacecraft
electronics to have improved tolerance to the various radiation
effects.
A limited amount of information is available from the
CRRES (Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite)
program [1,2], as well as a few others [3,4,5]. However, relaThe research in this paper was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,

design life, as well as beyond its radiation requirements. It was
originally designed to last three years, but the spacecraft still
operates and continues to provide data. Proton-induced displacement damage failures have occurred in some of its 4N49
optocouplers. Earlier failures have been observed with these
parts in applications involving status signals, which are not
flight-critical. More recently, failures have been observed in
thruster command circuits. The failure times and proton fluences correlate with the circuit applications’ required Current
Transfer Ratios (CTRs) [9]. The status circuits had a higher
CTR requirement (0.5), whereas the thruster circuit’s requirement was lower (0.2). Thus, it is logical that the degradation
would cause failure earlier in the circuit with the higher requirement, and in fact, this was the case.

Another important point is that anomalies cannot always
be fully resolved. Anomalies can occur for a variety of reasons
unrelated to ionizing radiation in electronic components, e.g.,
EMI, spacecraft charging, temperature effects, shock, vibration, and premature component failures for reliability reasons,
etc. This paper only discusses anomalies where radiation is
either the proven root cause or else a strong candidate.

DISCUSSION

A. Galileo
Galileo was launched in October 18, 1989 on a planetary
exploration mission to Jupiter. Its design was classical for
deep space missions designed in the early eighties. It was built
with fully tested, space-quality parts that were either radiationhardened or screened for hardness. Several safe-holds have
been observed (none of which significantly impacted the mission). These are believed to be due to SEUs. No destructive
latchups have been observed. (Far more detailed analysis is
provided in [6].) These observations are consistent with the
design approach, which included using hardened parts with
system-level redundancy including some error detection capability (i.e., parity), but limited correction capability. Error Detection and Correction (EDAC) was not used, because the
parts were designed for SEU immunity. Sandia manufactured
radiation-hardened CMOS versions of the AM2901 bit-slice
(known as the SA2901) and several related chips specifically
for Galileo, and these were tested by JPL and found to meet
all requirements [7].

At the time of the original calculations, the manufacturer of
the flight lot of parts was not known. Therefore, parts of two
qualified vendors were tested, and the results correlated well
with the observed failures [9]. The manufacturer of the flight
optocouplers has since been determined to be Texas Instruments (TI). Unfortunately, available test data for TI parts [10]
only covers the range of 1-10 mA, whereas the forward current of the status circuit application is 0.55 mA. However, if
CTR were extrapolated to 0.5 mA (as suggested by the spacing of the CTR data points over the 1-10 mA range), CTR
would be expected to drop below 0.5 at approximately 2
krads. This corresponds to a fluence of ~1.3 x 106 p/cm2,
which is consistent with the failure fluence calculated in [9].
The thruster latch valve circuits operate at 8 mA and only
require a CTR value of 0.2. These parts were predicted [9] to
fail 8.5-10 years after launch. One circuit failed in May 2001,
which was 8.75 years after launch, which was well inside the
predicted window of time for failure. The estimated fluence at
that time was 5.78 x 1010 p/cm2 (proton dose of 8.67 krads).
However, available test data for TI parts does not contain
enough information to calculate a failure fluence.

Galileo has been an extremely successful mission. Its mission has been extended twice, and it has now absorbed approximately four times more radiation than it was designed to
(~600 krads vs. 150 krads), and it continues to operate properly. None of the radiation anomalies has impacted the mission. All the appropriate actions were taken in the design to
assure that no radiation failures would occur.

C. Mars Pathfinder
Launched on December 4, 1996, to explore the surface of
Mars, this is another example of a mission that met all its mission requirements. Pathfinder and the Sojourner rover used
many parts that were either radiation hardened or else
screened to meet its radiation requirements. It did experience a
nondestructive anomaly in a modem circuit on the surface of
Mars, but the unit was still able to complete its mission. An
investigation concluded that the anomaly was not likely to
have been caused by an SEU or latchup.

As Galileo’s goals were met and exceeded, attention shifted
to extending its mission to accomplish further scientific investigation. One item to consider in such a mission extension is
the expected remaining life of its parts, which required considering both the radiation exposures accumulated thus far, plus
those anticipated in a mission extension. Analytical predictions have been made regarding total dose failure on DG-181
analog switches. Based on calculated total ionizing dose, at
least one of these parts has reached its circuit design threshold
for parametric failure [8]. This is not a problem, as Galileo no
longer relies on that part for any critical functions.

D. Cassini
Cassini was launched on October 15, 1997. It used a SolidState Recorder (SSR) instead of a mechanical tape recorder.
The SSR has experienced single-bit errors in line with predictions. However, the SSR has had a double-bit error rate much
higher than predicted. In addition, its Solid-State Power
Switches (SSPS) have averaged 1½ trips per year. These
anomalies are discussed in the following subsections.

In terms of lessons to offer for future spacecraft designers,
Galileo is basically a list of things done right. Use of modern
EDAC capability (i.e., modified Hamming code) is more typical in present designs, but Galileo’s approach worked well,
primarily because of its widespread use of hardened parts.
However, even hardened parts such as those used in Galileo
can experience occasional SEUs, and these are probably irreducible without use of redundancy and/or software that is alert
to detection of SEU-induced anomalies.

1) Uncorrectable Double-Bit Errors: Unlike the SEU
error rate, the number of uncorrectable, double-bit errors
observed in the Solid-State Recorder (SSR) was much higher
than originally predicted (i.e., orders of magnitude). Research
has shown that the high density dynamic RAMs (Oki 1Mb x 4
DRAMs, which was high density at the time) are very

B. TOPEX/Poseidon
Launched on August 10, 1992 into a 66°, 1336-km orbit,
this is another example of a mission that has met all requirements and still continues to operate well beyond its intended

susceptible to Multiple-Bit Upsets (MBUs) [11]. Furthermore,
while Error Detection and Correction (EDAC) was utilized as
required in the SSR (i.e., Single-Bit Correction, Double-Bit
Detection, known as SEC-DED), the design did not anticipate
the manner in which MBUs could occur within words. The
design uses DRAMs that are four bits wide, and the bits are
physically separated such that MBUs cannot occur in a 4-bit
segment. The same research showed that the SSR stored each
39-bit word divided across five DRAMs (32 bits of data plus 7
bits for EDAC). Thus, when a word is read, two read passes of
20 bits each (4 per DRAM) are required to obtain 39 bits. (The
40th bit is unused.) In the first read pass, the first 4-bit segment in each DRAM is accessed. However, the second read
pass for a word accesses the next 4-bit segment in each
DRAM. Unfortunately, each of the bits in the second read pass
is physically adjacent to its corresponding counterpart in the
first read pass. Thus, an MBU corrupts two bits in a 39-bit
word. Therefore, the SEC-DED EDAC cannot correct the
word. However, the same research noted (with the benefit of
hindsight) that this problem could have been corrected in the
design by switching the least significant address line with any
other address line. This would have eliminated the MBU
susceptibility, thereby greatly reducing the system-level
noncorrectable error rate.

Figure 1. Comparison of Cassini Solid-State Power Switch trips due to
Single-Event Transients (SETs) observed versus calculated.

Mean Time to Trip has roughly followed the expected GCR
flux increase. Since the solar maximum is expected to last for
another few years (i.e., through 2005), the trip rate is expected
to remain fairly constant for the rest of the voyage to Saturn,
as the GCR flux will remain near its minimum. (Cassini is due
to arrive at Saturn on July 4, 2004.)

2) Single-Event Transients (SETs): As noted earlier, Cassini also utilizes a number of Solid-State Power Switches
(206), and these have experienced seven trips in the 4½ years
since its launch [12]. The trips always occur in the same mode
(i.e., always tripping from the off state), and no switch has
tripped more than once. The cause of these trips has been
studied and documented [13,14]. A graph of the observed trips
(solid lines) is shown in Figure 1, and except for when two
trips occurred only 13 days apart, it shows a fairly smooth
curve. The dashed line in Figure 1 shows a prediction of how
many trips would be expected based on the Solar-modulated
GCR cycle and the data from [13] and [14]. The prediction
shows a decline in the trip rate and indicates a continued low
rate through the remainder of the voyage to Saturn. Extrapolation of the curve suggests that Cassini can expect to have
about two more trips before it reaches Saturn. The shape of the
curve suggests a gradual lengthening of time between trips.

E. QuikScat/Seawinds
Ball Aerospace provided a complete Flight Anomaly Log
for the Quick Scatterometer/Seawinds satellite, along with a
summary report [15]. QuikScat’s first anomaly was an SEU in
the Spacecraft Control Computer three days after launch. This
was a correctable error in an unused portion of memory. A
rate gyro and a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver
have been reported as failed and upsets were reported on the
1553 bus. However, Ball noted that the rate gyro failure was
not related to radiation, but was caused by a mirror degradation of the gyro.
The Motorola GPS receiver #1 (Viceroy model) lost half its
channels on August 27, 2000. It failed completely on May 11,
2001 after a minor proton event. Attempts to restart it were not
successful, and operations were switched to receiver #2. Ball
believes some options remain to revive the failed receiver, and
these will be tried when time permits. The reason for the failure is not yet known. However, these failures are consistent
with single-event latchup (SEL).

The Galactic Cosmic Ray flux is modulated by the solar cycle,
and the flux varies by a factor of 2 to 10 (most commonly, 4 to
5). The flux is greatest when solar activity is minimal, and it
is lowest when solar activity is maximal. The solar cycle is
near its maximum now, with many flares having occurred over
the past year. However, at launch, the solar cycle was near its
minimum. Thus, the GCR flux was near maximum at launch,
and has declined since that time. The GCR flux has been close
to minimum for the past couple of years. For its first three
years, its distance from the Sun ranged from as close as Venus
out to that of Mars, with one gravitational-assist flyby of the
Earth and two past Venus. With five of the trips occurring in
the inner solar system area, the initial fall-off in the trip rate
appears to be due more to modulation of the GCR rate as the
solar cycle has transitioned from minimum to maximum,
which would cause the GCR rate to decrease over this period
of time. The first four trips occurred about once every four
months through March 1999. However, after that, the trip rate
has decreased by a factor of 3 to once every 11 months and
has been virtually linear with time, roughly corresponding to
the GCR minimum due to solar max. (During this time, it has
traveled from the orbit of Venus out well past Jupiter.) The

Studies of other modern GPS receivers (e.g., the Collins
GEM-III and a more modern successor) reveal the presence of
many potentially latchable ICs. These include numerous linear
CMOS voltage converters and regulators, as well as various
large digital CMOS ICs, such as microprocessors, RAMs, and
custom ASICs. A latchup induced in any one of these could
result in a device burnout, which would cause a failure of the
receiver, or a microlatch (as noted in [4], which provides additional information on a GPS receiver in space).
This is complicated by the fact that many GPS receiver designs have battery-powered standby modes. Thus, when the
receiver is “off,” several circuits remain active on battery
power (sometimes using a CMOS DC-to-DC converter to
change the battery voltage to that required by the digital ICs).
These circuits include a clock/calendar function, memories to
hold ephemeris data, and if military accuracy is required, clas-

strictions on the tests and the statistics, and to advise the part
user on the limitations of the conclusions.

sified keys to enable the high accuracy positioning function. In
addition, certain power monitoring circuitry continually
checks for the presence of external bus voltage (e.g., +5 or
+3.3 Vdc) that is normally supplied by the host system when
the receiver is “on.” The clock and ephemeris allow the receiver to quickly determine which satellites to look for at a
given time when power to the receiver is turned on. This allows the receiver to obtain proper positioning information
much more rapidly (i.e., in seconds) than if the receiver had to
search for each satellite and download everything needed to
determine position (which can take several minutes). Thus, a
considerable number of parts are powered continually. Therefore, they are always susceptible to latchup in space, instead of
only when the receiver is powered “on.”

Often, the assumption of zero cross section based on such
statistically small sample sizes will not significantly impact a
system-level SEE assessment. This is because the system-level
response is typically dominated by a relatively small number
of part types (typically half a dozen to a dozen) such as microprocessors, a few memory types, a few digital ASICs or
FPGAs, and perhaps some large, linear CMOS parts.
F. DEEP SPACE 1
Also known as DS-1, this spacecraft, launched on October
24, 1998, flew various advanced demonstration technologies,
including an ion propulsion system. DS-1 experienced failure
of a stellar reference unit (SRU) [16] and an upset in an FPGA
register in the Gimbal Drive Electronics, which resulted in a
loss of power from one solar panel, causing a safe-hold [17].
However, this was corrected

Furthermore, some GPS receiver designs utilize large hybrids that contain numerous CMOS dice, many of which are at
least potentially susceptible to latchup. Considering the number of various types of ICs, and the probable mix of manufacturers, date codes, and foundries, traceability of such components is almost impossible. This makes it very difficult to determine hardness of parts already assembled into hybrids or
receivers, since as-built records are often not available. Thus,
latchup risk is very difficult to determine.

The SRU was power-cycled twice in an attempt to restore
functionality. This was unsuccessful. However, the SRU had
previously experiencing intermittent problems that started
occurring shortly after launch. While these had all been investigated, and various tests conducted, no explanation was ever
considered satisfactory. Thus, the final failure may be due to a
latchup, with earlier transient failures having been caused by
SEUs. But other failure modes could not be ruled out (e.g.,
thermal stress, aging, shock/vibration stresses associated with
launch, etc.). Prior to the final failure, the longest outage was
28 minutes. While some SEUs can or have caused failures that
can require long system recovery times (seconds to several
minutes), there is no ready explanation of how an SEUinduced failure could result in a recovery time of 28 minutes,
unless some thermal event was induced (e.g., a nondestructive
latchup or some other high current mode). Thus, a thermal
event induced by a cosmic ray is a possibility. However, total
failure of an integrated circuit or a transistor is consistent with
a latchup or single-event gate rupture (SEGR) caused by a
cosmic ray. Unfortunately, there is insufficient information to
confirm latchup or SEGR as the failure mode, although there
are several parts in the SRU with known or suspected latchup
susceptibility.

On the positive side, latchup is not a common event, and
from an SEU standpoint, at least some GPS receivers that
have been tested for SEU have proven to be fairly robust [4].
Errors can be tolerated or corrected in most cases, keys can be
rewritten, ephemeris data and time can be updated from the
satellites, and most system designs can tolerate either occasional unavailability or degraded accuracy. In at least some
systems, even entire failure of the GPS receiver will not necessarily cause failure of the mission. This will depend on the
system architecture, the nature of the specific failure, and the
nature of the receiver’s usage in the system.
However, with regard to latchup, the negative aspect is that
for most missions lasting a few to several years, the probability of latchup occurring in one potentially susceptible part or
another becomes fairly high. This is partly mitigated by the
likelihood that certain latchups are local within a chip rather
than involving the entire chip, or the latchup is otherwise nondestructive. Thus, power cycling can often be effective in restoring proper functioning in such cases. In addition, SEL testing is often conducted at high temperatures, whereas electronics in many space systems typically operate at temperatures
that are more moderate in order to improve reliability. Lower
temperatures generally reduce the probability of latchup.

G. Mars Odyssey
Launched on April 7, 2001, Odyssey successfully arrived at
Mars on October 24, 2001. It has been performing very well.
However, a couple of weeks after launch (April 24), it went
into Safe Mode due to corrupted memory [18]. It was determined that this was caused by a cosmic ray ion striking a diagnostic latch in a DRAM, which resulted in a burst error. The
event was termed a MEEB (Memory Error External Bus) after
the symptom observed. This was consistent with ground radiation test results on the IBM LUNA-C DRAMs [19]. The
software was revised to mitigate future events of this type.

Another problem with regard to latchup is the statistical
limitations related to small sample sizes typically used in SEL
testing. Very often, only three to five parts are tested. When
none are observed to latch, they are then declared to be
“latchup-immune.” While this can be a fair statement for the
tested samples, it is statistically questionable to extrapolate
immunity for an entire lot of parts (let alone other lots) based
on such small sample sizes. This is typically justified by citing
the high costs of testing and the limited availability of test
samples, especially when such samples can be quite expensive. These are perfectly legitimate arguments, and it is not
appropriate to devote disproportionate resources to testing for
every possible effect to the highest accuracy with large sample
sizes. The message here is simply to not overstate conclusions
when small sample sizes are used, to note the appropriate re-

H. GRACE
The Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE)
consists of two spacecraft that were launched together on
March 17, 2002. The experiment is a collaboration of many
organizations (government, industrial, and academic), several
of which are international [20]. The two spacecraft orbit in
tandem 220 km apart in a near-polar orbit (~485 km inclined

some latchup sensitivity in testing, they were rated as moderate risk, due to low predicted event rates and/or nondestructive nature of observed latchups. The ASIC was observed in ground radiation testing to latch in several ways
(both destructively and nondestructively) with a wide range of
currents. The estimated latchup rate in orbit was initially predicted to be two to three times a year during normal solar activity, but up to two to three times a day if hit by a large solar
flare [25]. However, based on JPL test data [26], the mean
time to latchup for the current solar condition (i.e., solar
maximum) is estimated to be between 100-200 years [27].
This is consistent with ~20 ASIC-years of powered, on-orbit
experience without a destructive latchup [22]. Not all ASIC
latchup modes were destructive. Thus, it was assumed that if
the GPS receiver were powered off during a solar flare, the
ASIC only represented a moderate risk [25].

at 89°). They use modified BlackJack GPS receivers to obtain
precise measurements of position, including micron-level data
from a Ka band link between the spacecraft. Thus, slight deviations from expected orbital paths are recorded, and these
are used to map the Earth’s gravity with unprecedented precision.
This project utilized a wide spectrum of part types ranging
from unhardened, commercial types all the way up to radiation-hardened, class S parts. However, heritage hardware designs that had successfully flown before were utilized where
possible. Also, EDAC was utilized, and some modules were
provided some protection against latchup by incorporating
overcurrent detection and circumvention circuitry (although
this was done at the board level, not the part level). The AsBuilt Parts Lists for the various modules were reviewed by
JPL prior to launch, and some radiation risks were noted.
(Risks were defined as those that would result in component
failure, such as total dose, single-event gate rupture (SEGR),
or latchup, which was presumed to be destructive unless circumvented or known to be nondestructive.) Due to the moderate total dose requirements of the mission, no parts were
judged high risk. However, some parts were judged high risk
with respect to latchup and/or SEGR. These risks are partly
offset by use of redundancy and latchup protection circuitry.

IV. OBSERVATIONS
Redundancy is a highly effective approach. However, it
cannot be relied upon too heavily for protection against radiation-induced failures. The reason for this is that redundant
modules are included to protect against any type of failure in a
system, not just radiation-induced failures. Thus, if two modules are used where each has a radiation failure probability of
10%, one is tempted to calculate that the failure rate for the
system will only be 1%. However, for a cold-spared module,
the actual failure probability for the set is somewhat higher.
But it is certainly possible for either module to fail due to
other reasons unrelated to radiation. In fact, there have been a
number of instances where a redundant module did not even
survive launch stresses to reach orbital insertion. In such
cases, the system is reduced to single-string status, in which
case, any failure of the remaining module can result in partial
or total loss of the functions performed by that module.

In its first four months on orbit, GRACE has experienced
several anomalies. Single-event upset is a possible cause in
several of these, including resets, double-bit errors, and some
GPS errors. Problems developed with one of the two Instrument Control Units (ICU) on one of the spacecraft, which
failed. When the ICU anomaly occurred, there were also
abrupt changes in the current from the primary power to the
ICU. Thus, it is possible that the ICU anomaly was caused by
a latchup, as it does contain parts that may be susceptible to
latchup. However, the limited diagnostic information that is
available, along with the complex interactions between circuit
elements, does not allow a definite conclusion to be made.
While latchup was initially suspected, the anomaly investigation team concluded that the failure was most likely caused by
failure of a DC/DC converter [21]. The spacecraft is now
operating with its redundant ICU, and the two spacecraft are
operating as expected.

Latchup circumvention has become increasingly popular for
space programs (and it’s long been used in many military systems to protect them from latchup that could be caused by
high dose rates emitted by nuclear weapons). For space programs, parts are typically tested for latchup using latchup detection and protection circuitry. This circuitry monitors current
in the Device Under Test (DUT). When an overcurrent condition characteristic of latchup is detected, power to the DUT is
very rapidly removed to protect it from burnout. Parts so
tested typically survive and operate properly after power is
reapplied, and they are subsequently characterized for latchup
over several LET values. The success of this technique in
laboratory testing has led to incorporation of this approach to
protect sensitive parts used in spacecraft design. Obviously,
the twin keys to success in this approach are rapid detection of
a latchup overcurrent and equally rapid removal of power.
Both of these schemes depend on close proximity to the part
to be circumvented. Ideally, the device currents should be
monitored individually, and when the current exceeds a predetermined safe, peak value, the device power must be rapidly
removed.

I.

GPS Receivers
The BlackJack GPS receiver contains many SEE-sensitive
parts. No destructive latchup has occurred in this receiver
aboard the CHAMP, SAC-C, and Jason spacecraft after more
than four cumulative years on orbit [22]. Since the most recent
software upload, the receiver on CHAMP has experienced
eight resets in three months, and the systems operations team
believes that these are caused by a watchdog timer that resets
the receiver when the algorithm cannot track enough GPS
satellites to calculate a navigation solution. This receiver utilizes Dynamic Random Access Memories (DRAMs), but does
not incorporate EDAC. Thirteen part types had been identified
as latchup risks and were subsequently tested [23,24]. Seven
types (CGS74LCT2524 clock driver, LMC6081 op amp,
LTC1153 circuit breaker, MAX962 comparator, MC74LCX08
AND gate, MC74HC4538 multivibrator, and SN74LVT16244
buffer/driver) showed no latchup sensitivity during testing.
However, while test results for the AM29LV800 Flash memory, DS1670 system controller, DS1803 digital potentiometer,
MT48LCIN16 SDRAM, and OR2T15A25240 FPGA showed

This approach has three shortcomings. The first is that devices tested for latchup are often not characterized for their
latchup destruction parameters. It is very difficult to determine if power removal is fast enough to prevent damage, if
devices are not tested to allow destruction. (Hardened military
systems face a similar problem, but they have several advantages in this regard. First, high dose rate is much easier to detect than overcurrent. Also, dose rate can be detected much

earlier than overcurrent. Finally, long-term reliability is generally not essential after such an exposure.)

cated for radiation effects. While it may seem counterintuitive,
this has actually helped determine the appropriate resource
level to devote to mission assurance and radiation effects. (If
too much is devoted to mission assurance, there is less available for a mission. On the other hand, if too little is devoted to
mission assurance, the risk of losing a mission increases.)
Thus, only by varying the level of mission assurance resources
can an appropriate balance be determined.

The second shortcoming (noted earlier) is that detection and
protection are most effective when performed at the part level.
However, due to cost, it is more attractive to perform this at
the board level. Unfortunately, the desire to reduce cost conflicts with the need for individual protection.
Finally, recent research at JPL has shown that, even when
parts have been circumvented and appear to function properly
afterward, significant latent damage was observed [28,29].
Examples included melted and displaced aluminum inside
such parts. Thus, even when latchup protection is employed, it
is necessary to test such parts using the actual flight circuitry
planned, perform post-test examination of circumvented parts
to check for latent damage, and test some parts to destruction
in order to determine design margin.

In terms of recommendations, appropriate assessment of
latchup and single-event gate rupture must remain high priorities with testing highly recommended. While latchup circumvention is sometimes used, it is not recommended as a standard design technique unless the proper part and circuit testing
is performed. Even when this is done, parts must be tested in
the flight-configuration circumvention circuitry, and post-test
Destructive Physical Analysis photographs of parts that have
been circumvented during testing must be examined for signs
of latent damage.

V. SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This paper has discussed radiation effect predictions and
observations on spacecraft systems, and has compared them
where possible. The purpose of this effort has been to identify
failure modes that can be mitigated in future system designs.
A prime example of this was the investigation of the high rate
of uncorrectable double-bit errors observed in the Cassini
Solid-State Recorder, as well as the trips of its Solid-State
Power Switches. In cases of permanent damage, predictions
have been fairly accurate when the environment has remained
close to expected values. However, single-event effects are
more random, especially as they affect system response.

In terms of lessons learned, each of these missions offers
valuable advice. Galileo is obviously the success that all missions strive for. Repeating this degree of success is more challenging now for a variety of reasons, the most important of
which are resource constraints and the extensive changes in
the semiconductor industry. However, with judicious choice
of parts, careful analysis, testing, and appropriate application
in system designs, hardness requirements can still be met.
(Cassini and Mars Odyssey are good examples of this.)

TOPEX/Poseidon showed the importance of considering
displacement damage in susceptible components such as optocouplers. While this mission has far exceeded all of its goals
and requirements, it shows the need to consider and appropriately derate such parts in future spacecraft designs.
Cassini has continued to perform quite well, despite some
unexpected anomalies. Study of these anomalies has improved
understanding of the relationships between parts and the system architectures in which they are used, and this is expected
to be helpful in future spacecraft designs.
Deep Space 1 met all mission goals, including those of
mission extensions. While some anomalies did occur, these
were all resolved, suitable workarounds were developed and
implemented, and this provided extremely valuable experience
in investigation and resolution of anomalies.
The design era and component complexity do not appear
to have been significant influences on anomalies or failures.
However, more anomalies and failures have tended to occur
when a lower level of mission assurance resources was allo-
